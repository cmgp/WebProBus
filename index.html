			<h1>Historia de San Carlos</h1>
			<p>It was founded on October 1763 by the Spanish Governor Pedro Antonio de Cevallos, to discourage the foundation of Portuguese settlements in the region. Its name is originated from that of the King of Spain at the time, Charles III.

			It had acquired the status of "Villa" (town) before the Independence of Uruguay, which was elevated to "Ciudad" (city) on 18 December 1929 by the Act of Ley Nº 8.559.

			<h1>Historia de Maldonado</h1>
			<p>The origin of Maldonado’s name dates back to January of 1530, when Sebastian Cabot, an Italian explorer, departed for Castilla and left his Lieutenant, Fransisco Maldonado, in what is now the bay of Maldonado. After the Treaty of Madrid , when they started to divide Spanish and Portuguese properties in that region of America, the military governor of Montevideo, José Joaquín de Viana, suggested to the King that they should establish two populations, one in Maldonado and the other in Minas. In August of 1755, still waiting for a response from the King, Viana decided to leave with some families and head towards Portezuelo. It was there that Maldonado was founded. Viana later left the settlement, leaving the inhabitants with animals and sufficient supplies to live. The population was able to survive and grow due to the profits from growing crops and raising livestock. [1] When he returned 20 months later, he brought 7 indigenous families with him and incorporated them into the small village to help the population grow. He also moved the settlement to their current site.[2] The buildings that are built around the town square in Maldonado today, including the cathedral, are reminiscent of traditional Spanish style, giving evidence that the Spanish royalty were involved in the growth and development of Maldonado. [3]In May of 1783, the population had grown and the villagers gave Don Luis Estremera the power to oversee the creation of a city council, thus legally establishing the city 25 years after Viana had founded it. After years of attempts, on March 14, 1787, an election was held and approved 8 days later, and the City Council of Maldonado was elected and the Town of Maldonado became the City of San Fernando De Maldonado in honor of Ferdinand VI of Spain. With a City Council established, the people of Maldonado could defend their rights as citizens.

			<h1>Historia de Punta del Este</h1>
			<p>The first Europeans to set foot in what is now Punta del Este were the Spanish at the beginning of the 16th century. However, the colonization of the area actually began around Maldonado at the end of the 18th century due to Portuguese expansionism.[citation needed] Punta del Este and its surroundings (Maldonado and Punta Ballena) at the end of the 19th century were kilometers of sand and dunes, but in 1896 Antonio Lussich bought 4,447 acres (1,800 ha) of uninhabited land and there he started a botanical garden, Arboretum Lussich, and planted trees and plants from all over the world. Later the trees started to spread on their own, and now the area is full of mostly Pines, Eucalyptus, Acacias and various species of bushes.

			On 5 July 1907, it was declared a "Pueblo" (village) by Act of Ley 3.186.[6] Its status was elevated to "Ciudad" (city) on 2 July 1957 by the Act of Ley Nº 12.397.[7]

			Punta del Este hosted an American Summit in 1967 attended by U.S. President Lyndon Johnson. In September 1986, Punta del Este played host to the start of the Uruguay Round of international trade negotiations. These negotiations ultimately led to the creation of the World Trade Organization in 1994.
